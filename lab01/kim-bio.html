    I am an Information management& technology major interested in data analytics and web development.
    I learned Java and Python from my high school and freshmen year in college
    I moved to America when I was 12 years old. My favorite hobby is eating good foods with my family or friends. I also like to workout for my free time
    I'm so excited for this class!
