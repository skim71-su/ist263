            Seven extraordinary women came together to establish Kappa Phi Lambda Sorority, Inc. at Binghamton University on March 9, 1995. These seven founders: Elizabeth Choi, Karen Eng, Rei Hirasawa, Hee Cho Moon, Chae Yoo Park, Samantha Somchanhmavong, and Connie Yang united with a single vision of providing women with the chance to use their pride in their heritage to become leaders of society.<br>
            On November 16, 1997, our five chapter sisters established the third chapter of Kappa Phi Lambda, which is the first Asian-Interest sorority on the Syracuse University Campus.

            <h4>Charter (Fall '97)</h4>
            <img src="../Project/media/charter.jpg" alt="Charter Picture">
            Gamma Chapter at Syracuse University was founded on November 16, 1997 by five diverse women with a sacred bond and a unified dream. The charters were friends first before they wanted to be sisters. It was just a random thought at the time that quickly escalated into a reality when they scouted out various sororities and came upon Kappa Phi Lambda.<br>
            They planned to bring forth the first Asian Greek organization on SU grounds. They envisioned the establishment of an organization that was going to change the norm, break cultural barriers, and most of all, make a difference. It was their loyalty and respect for one another that gave them the extra incentive to achieve their goals.<br>
            With their strength, they built a legacy that will continue to strive for the better, help the community and make a difference in the lives of others. With their love, even all the hardships that entailed for them to give birth to Gamma Chapter, made it all worth it.
